    <h2>
      I've been studying Web development since early 2020 through books, Harb
      and YouTube, implementing my own projects as part of my practice. Learned
      the basics of HTML and CSS, mastered JavaScript and several frameworks.
      <br />
      <br />
      I am currently finishing courses from the GeekBrains portal. Working as a
      Frontend Web developer on the freelance market since 2021. My English is
      B1, I can read documentation quite easily.
